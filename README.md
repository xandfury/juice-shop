OWASP Juice Shop is an intentionally insecure webapp for security
trainings written entirely in Javascript which encompasses the entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten) and other
severe security flaws.

## Description

Juice Shop is written in Node.js, Express and AngularJS. It was the
first application written entirely in JavaScript listed in the
[OWASP VWA Directory](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Vulnerable_Web_Applications_Directory_Project).

The application contains over 30 challenges of varying difficulty where
the user is supposed to exploit the underlying vulnerabilities. The
hacking progress is tracked on a score board. Finding this score board
is actually one of the (easy) challenges!

Apart from the hacker and awareness training use case, pentesting
proxies or security scanners can use Juice Shop as a "guinea
pig"-application to check how well their tools cope with
Javascript-heavy application frontends and REST APIs.

> Translating "dump" or "useless outfit" into German yields "Saftladen"
> which can be reverse-translated word by word into "juice shop". Hence
> the project name. That the initials "JS" match with those of
> "Javascript" was purely coincidental!

## Main Selling Points

- Easy-to-install: Choose between
  [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility),
  [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
  [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) to run on
  Windows/Mac/Linux
- Self-contained: Additional dependencies are pre-packaged or will be
  resolved and downloaded automatically
- Self-healing: The simple SQLite database is wiped and regenerated from
  scratch on every server startup
- Gamification: On a Score Board the application keeps track of
  successfully exploited vulnerabilities
- Free and Open source: Licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE) with
  no hidden costs or caveats

### Packaged Distributions [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bkimminich/juice-shop/total.svg)](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest) [![SourceForge](https://img.shields.io/sourceforge/dt/juice-shop.svg)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/juice-shop/)

1. Install a 64bit [node.js](#nodejs-version-compatibility) on your
   Windows (or Linux) machine
2. Download `juice-shop-<version>_<node-version>_<os>_x64.zip` (or
   `.tgz`) attached to
   [latest release](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)
3. Unpack and run `npm start` in unpacked folder
4. Browse to <http://localhost:3000>

> Each packaged distribution includes some binaries for SQLite bound to
> the OS and node.js version which `npm install` was executed on.

### Amazon EC2 Instance

1. Setup an _Amazon Linux AMI_ instance
2. In _Step 3: Configure Instance Details_ unfold _Advanced Details_ and
   copy the script below into _User Data_
3. In _Step 6: Configure Security Group_ add a _Rule_ that opens port 80
   for HTTP

> features but cannot be considered stable.

## Troubleshooting [![Gitter](http://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-join%20chat-1dce73.svg)](https://gitter.im/bkimminich/juice-shop)

> If you need help with the application setup please check the
> Troubleshooting section below or post your specific problem or
> question in the
> [official Gitter Chat](https://gitter.im/bkimminich/juice-shop).

- After changing to a different Node.js version it is a good idea to
  delete `npm_modules` and re-install all dependencies from scratch with
  `npm install`
- If you are experiencing
  [Error 128](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/50) from some GitHub
  repos during `bower install` execution, run `git config --global
  url."https://".insteadOf git://` and try `npm install` again
- If using Boot2Docker (Docker inside VirtualBox on Windows) make sure
  that you also enable port forwarding from Host `127.0.0.1:3000` to
  `0.0.0.0:3000` for TCP
- If `npm install` fails after an update of your local copy during
  `bower install` complaining about version issues, delete
  `/app/bower_components` and try again to remove outdated versions that
  cause conflicts
- If during `npm install` the `sqlite3` no binaries can be downloaded
  for your system, the setup falls back to building from source with
  `node-gyp`. Check the
  [`node-gyp` installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
  for additional tools you might need to install (e.g. Python 2.7, GCC,
  Visual C++ Build Tools etc.)
- You may find it easier to find vulnerabilities using a pen test tool.
  I strongly recommend
  [Zed Attack Proxy](https://code.google.com/p/zaproxy/) which is open
  source and very powerful, yet beginner friendly.
